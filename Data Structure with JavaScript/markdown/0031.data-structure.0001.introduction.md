# What is an data-structure and algorithm?

## What is Data Structure?

A data structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the data efficiently and effectively. The main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities. An efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data.

## What is Algorithm?

Algorithm is defined as a process or set of well-defined instructions that are typically used to solve a particular group of problems or perform a specific type of calculation. To explain in simpler terms, it is a set of operations performed in a step-by-step manner to execute a task.

> * An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.
> * An Algorithm, in computer programming,
>   * is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions,
>   * typically executed in a computer,
>   * to solve a class of problems or to perform a common task.

## What is Data-Structure & Algorithm?

> * Data-Structure is a way to structurize the data in a organized way
> * And Algorithm is used in the Data-Structure to organised/structurized the data

## What is Data-Structure & Algorithm?

> * Data-Structure is a way to arrange the data.
> * And Algorithm is steps or process to arrange the data.
> * And Algorithm is steps or process that is used in the data-structure to arrange the data.

## Recipe analogy

* An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem

## Characteristics

* Well defined inputs and outputs
* Each step should be clear and unambiguous
* Language independent

## Why algorithms?

* As a developer, you're going to come across problems that you need to solve
* Learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve those problems
* One problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms
* Every algorithm comes with its own tradeoffs when it comes to performance
* There can be any number of ways, a specific set of instructions can be defined to perform the same task.
