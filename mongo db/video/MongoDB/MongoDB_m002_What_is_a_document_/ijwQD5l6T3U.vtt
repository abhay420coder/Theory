00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Let's take a closer look
at what documents are

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.600
and how they're used to store
data in a structured way.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.780
A document is a way to
organize and store data

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.390
as a set of field-value pairs.

5
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.660
Just like this, where the
field is a unique identifier

6
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.120
for some data
point, and the value

7
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.100
is data related to
a given identifier.

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.490
In this example,
there is a field name,

9
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.220
and the value is Lakshmi.

10
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.770
We will look closer at
documents and their structures

11
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.260
once we get our hands
on an actual data set.

12
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.630
But for now, this is a
simple example of a document.

13
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.690
A collection would contain many
documents similar to this one.

14
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.630
And a database would contain
multiple collections.

15
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.510
In this lesson, we defined
what document and collection

16
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.870
mean in MongoDB.

17
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.830
In the next chapters, we will
start querying collections

18
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.990
for documents and interact
with the database in general.
