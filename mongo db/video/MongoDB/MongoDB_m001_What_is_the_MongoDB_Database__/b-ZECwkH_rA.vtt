00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.910
So what is the MongoDB Database.

3
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.350
A database, meaning a structured
way to store and access data.

4
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.950
More specifically, it
is a NoSQL database.

5
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.610
NoSQL is a very generic term
used to describe any data store

6
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.240
that doesn't use legacy approach
of related tables of data.

7
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.360
This means that you're storing
your data in an organized way,

8
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.870
but not in rows and columns

9
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.910
An example of
NoSQL databases can

10
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.610
be anything from a
library card catalog,

11
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.240
to a more sophisticated
data store like MongoDB.

12
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.630
Since the range of what
NoSQL means is so wide,

13
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.740
we must narrow our
definition further.

14
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.500
MongoDB is a NoSQL
document database.

15
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.240
This means that data in
MongoDB is stored as documents.

16
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.570
We will cover what a document
is in the next lesson.

17
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.080
These documents are in
turn stored in what we

18
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.270
call collections of documents.

19
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.830
That's why MongoDB is
categorized as a NoSQL document

20
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.240
database.

21
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.819
In conclusion, the
MongoDB database

22
00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.930
is a NoSQL document database.
