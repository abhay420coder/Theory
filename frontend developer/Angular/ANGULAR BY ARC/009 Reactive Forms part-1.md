### Reactive Forms - Introduction

* **Reactive Forms are a way to create Forms** in Angular application
* What's different is how we implement, design and handle the form and the data
* All the form elements, user interactions and validations are handled in the component class
* We will make use of Angular's built in **formGroup** and **formControI**
* Using Reactive Forms we can control better data binding
* Exclusive define custom regular expression patterns of error handling
* We will need to import **ReactiveFormsModuIe** in our app module
* Very flexible and allows users to define, develop complex requirements of forms
> * More logic in the component class and less in HTML mark up itself
* Angular maintains the state information of forms at all times
  * ng-touched
  * ng-untouched
  * ng-dirty
  * ng-pristine
  * ng-valid
  * ng-invalid
