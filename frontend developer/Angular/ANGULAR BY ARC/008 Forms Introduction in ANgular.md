### Static or Template Driven Forms
* Easy to use
* Template driven forms are simple and straight forward
* All the validations, form elements are all defined in the template file
* We will need to import FormsModuIe in app module to work with Template driven forms
### Dynamic or Reactive or Model Driven Forms
* All the form elements, user interactions and validations are handled in the component class
* We will make use of Angular's built in formGroup and formControI
* Can control better data binding
* Exclusive define custom regular expression patterns of error handling
* We will need to import ReactiveFormsModuIe in our app module
* Very flexible and allows users to define, develop complex requirements of forms
* More logic in the component class and less in HTML mark up itself
