    "  * NodeJs is built on `Google Chrome’s V8 engine`, \n",
    "    * and for this reason its execution time is very fast and it runs very quickly.\n",
    "* There are more than 50,000 bundles available in the Node Package Manager and \n",
    "  * for that reason \n",
    "    * developers can import any of the packages \n",
    "      * any time according to their needed functionality \n",
    "        * for which a lot of time is saved.\n",
    "* As NodeJs do not need to wait for an API to return data , \n",
    "  * so for building real time and data intensive web applications, \n",
    "  * it is very useful. \n",
    "* It is totally asynchronous in nature that means it is totally non-blocking.\n",
    "* The loading time for an audio or video is reduced by NodeJs \n",
    "  * because there is better synchronization of the code \n",
    "    * between the client and server for having the same code base.\n",
    "* As NodeJs is open-source \n",
    "  * and it is nothing but a JavaScript framework , \n",
    "  * so for the developers who are already used to JavaScript, \n",
    "    * for them starting developing their projects with NodeJs is very easy.\n"

    "# Features of NodeJs\n",
    "Now let us discuss on some of the features of NodeJs:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Asynchronous in Nature and Event driven:- \n",
    "\n",
    "* The servers made with the NodeJs never waits for the from an API. \n",
    "* Without waiting for the data from the API, \n",
    "  * it directly moves to the next API. \n",
    "* So all the APIs of NodeJS are totally non-blocking in nature. \n",
    "* In order to receive and track all the responses of the previous API requests, \n",
    "  * it follows an event driven mechanism. \n",
    "* Hence we can say that all the NodeJs API are non-blocking in nature.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Single Threaded Architecture:- \n",
    "\n",
    "* With event looping, \n",
    "  * a single threaded architecture is followed by NodeJs \n",
    "  * and for this architecture makes NodeJs more scalable. \n",
    "* In contrast to other servers, \n",
    "  * limited threads are created by them for processing the requests. \n",
    "* Whereas for the event driven mechanism, \n",
    "  * the NodeJS servers reply in a non-blocking or an asynchronous manner \n",
    "  * and for this reason NodeJS becomes more scalable. \n",
    "* If we compare NodeJs with other traditional servers like Apache HTTP servers, \n",
    "  * then we can say NodeJs handles a larger number of requests. \n",
    "* A single threaded program is followed by NodeJS \n",
    "  * and this allows NodeJs to process a huge amount of requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scalable:-\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nowadays, scalable software is demanded by most of the companies. \n",
    "* One of the most pressing concerns in Software Development is addressed by NodeJs and that is scalability.\n",
    "* Concurrent requests can be handled very efficiently using NodeJs. \n",
    "* A cluster module is used by NodeJs \n",
    "  * for managing the load balancing \n",
    "  * for all the active CPU cores. \n",
    "* The most appealing feature of NodeJs is that \n",
    "  * it can partition the applications horizontally and \n",
    "  * this partition procedure is mainly achieved by it due to the use of child processes. \n",
    "* Using this feature, \n",
    "  * the distinct app versions are provided to the different target audiences \n",
    "  * and also for customization it allows them for catering to the client preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quick Execution time for code:- \n",
    "\n",
    "* `V8` JavaScript runtime motor is used by NodeJs \n",
    "  * and this is also used by Google chrome. \n",
    "* A wrapper is provided for the JavaScript by the hub \n",
    "  * and for that reason the runtime motor becomes faster \n",
    "  * and for this reason inside NodeJs, the preposition process of the requests also become faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compatibility on the cross platforms:- \n",
    "\n",
    "* Different types of systems like Windows, UNIX, LINUX, MacOS and other mobile devices can use NodeJs. \n",
    "* For generating a self-sufficient execution, \n",
    "  * it can be paired with any appropriate package.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uses JavaScript:-\n",
    "\n",
    "* From an engineer's perspective, it is a v\n",
    "  * ery important aspect of NodeJs that this framework uses JavaScript .\n",
    "* Most of the developers are familiar with JavaScript, \n",
    "  * so for them it becomes very easier to grab NodeJs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fast Data Streaming:- \n",
    "\n",
    "* The processing time of the data \n",
    "  * that have been transmitted to different streams takes a long time. \n",
    "* Whereas for processing the data, \n",
    "  * NodeJs takes a very short amount of time and it does it at a very fast rate. \n",
    "* NodeJs saves a lot of time \n",
    "  * because the files are processed and uploaded simultaneously by NodeJs. \n",
    "* So as a result, \n",
    "  * the overall speed of data and video streaming is improved by NodeJs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No Buffering :- \n",
    "\n",
    "*`The data is never buffered in NodeJs application."
