## Python Data Types

* Numeric Type :- int , float , complex
* Text Type :- str
* Sequence Types :- list , tuple , range
* Mapping Type :- dict
* Set Types :- set , frozenset
* Boolean Type :- bool
* Binary Types :- bytes , bytearray , memoryview
* File

| Example                                     | Data Type  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| x = "Hello World"                           | str        |
| x = 20                                      | int        |

| or               | Returns True if one of the statements is true            | x < 5 or x < 4        |
| not              | Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true | not(x < 5 and x < 10) |

#### Python Identity Operators

* Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:| Identity Operator | Description                                            | Example    |
  | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
  | is                | Returns True if both variables are the same object            | x is y     |
  | is not            | Returns True if both variables are not the same object        | x is not y |

#### Python Membership Operators

* Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

| Membership Operator | Description                                                                      | Example    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |

#### Parentheses `()`

* parentheses means small bracket `()`.
* parentheses does not automatically imply the creation of a tuple.
* you can still use parentheses to modify the precedence of an expression
  * example :-
    * result = 3 * 4 + 5 = 17
    * result = 3 * (4+5) = 27

---

#### Mixed Type In expression

* if an expression contains mixed variable types ,
  * then the return value is of the most complex type contained within the expression.
  * example :-
    * result = 3*2.5 = 7.5
    * integer * floating_point_number = floating_point_number

---

#### Operator Overloading

* The term **operator overloading** refers to the ability of a language
  * to perform different operations on different object types
  * when using the same operator.
* From a programming prespective ,
  * the ability of a language to support operator overloading allows for a simplified programming process.

> * For example , the + operator is used to perform below operation
>   * add two numbers
>   * concat two string

> * For example , the [:] operator is used to perform below operation
>   * extract slices from strings
>   * extract slices from tuples
>   * extract slices from lists

* The operator performs the same operation on each object ,
  * even through the objects store and use their informationin different ways.

---

## Numbers

* Python has a number object to hold a number.
* There is no restriction on what type of number can be stored within a number object.

### Integer Constants

```python
number = 1234
number = -1234
```

* Zero is considered to be a number.

  * `zero = 0`
* 0 (zero) equates to a value of **false**

  * and any other numbers equates to **true**.
* This allows you to use integers

  * for simple Boolean values without the need for an additional data type.

### HexaDecimal and Octal Constants

* HexaDecimal constants are `0x` or `0X` prefixed to a number.
* Octal constants are `0` prefixed to a number.

```py
decimal = 255
hexaDecimalA = 0xff
hexaDecimalB = 0Xff
octal = 0377
```

### Long Integers

* Long Integer must append an `l` or `L` to the end of the number constants.
* you can  literally create an integer one thousand digits long.

```py
  longA = 123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789L  
  longB = 123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789l  
```

### Floating - Point Constants

* scientific notation

```py
floatA = 1234.5678

floatB = 12.345678E6 # 12.345678 * (10 ** 6) = 12345678
```

### Complex Number Constants

* complex numbers -
  * the real and imaginary parts are seperated by a plus sign
  * and the imaginary number uses a single `j` or `J` suffix

```py
cplxA = 1 + 2j
cplxB = 1.2 + 3.4j
cplxC = 1 + 2J
cplxD = 1.2 + 3.4J
```

### Numeric Operators for all Number Types

### Numeric Functions

* **abs(x)**  :-
  * Returns the absolute (numerical) value of a number , ignoring any signage.
  * if the `x` is a complex number , the magnitude is returned.

---

* **coerce(x,y)** :-
  * Translate the two numbers `x`  and  `y` into a common type ,
    * using the normal expression rules ,
    * returning the two number as a tuple.
  * For example :- the statement **coerce(2,3.5)** returns **coerce(2.0,3.5)**

---

* **divmod(x,y)** :-
  * Divides `x` by `y` returning a tuple
    * containing the quotient and remainder as derived by long divison
  * This function is effectively equivalent to **(a/b , a%b)** .

---

* **pow(x, y)**  :-

  * Raises `x` to the power of `y`
    * Note that the   return-value-type is the same as the type-of-x
* **pow(x, y [,z])**  :-

  * if the argument `z` is add
  * then the return-value is  `pow(x, y)%z`
  * but it is calculated more efficiently.

---

* **round(x [, y])**  :-

  * Round the floating-point number `x` to `0` digits
    * or to `y` digits after the decimal point if `y` is specified.
  * Note that the number returned is still a floating-point number.
    * Use `int` to convert a floating-point number to an integer ,
    * but note that no rounding takes place.

## Sequence Object

* Which Object is accessed by index that is called **Sequence Object**
* The term sequence is impotant here
  * because Python gives special capabilitiesto objects that are based on sequences.
* Sequence Obhject :- sting , list , tuple , set ,
* String,Tupels are immutable , that is  , they cannot be changed in place.

## Strings

* single-line-Strings constants are defined using single (`'.....'`) or double quotes (`"....."`)
* multi-line-Strings constants are defined using triple-single (`'''.....'''`) or triple-double (`"""....."""`) quotes
  * just make sure that you use the same number of quotes to start and terminate the constant
  * To create a single , unbroken paragraph of text ,
