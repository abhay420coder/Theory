# JavaScript Comments

* JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.
* JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

```js
// single Line Comment

// Multi 
// Line 
// Comment

/*
Multi
Line 
Comment
*/
```


# variable :-

* A variable is a “named storage” for data. 
* To create a variable in JavaScript, use the `let/var/const` keyword.

```js

let name = 'Abhay'

let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';
That might seem shorter, but we don’t recommend it. For the sake of better readability, please use a single line per variable.

// The multiline variant is a bit longer, but easier to read:

let user = 'John';
let age = 25;
let message = 'Hello';
// Some people also define multiple variables in this multiline style:

let user = 'John',
  age = 25,
  message = 'Hello';
// …Or even in the “comma-first” style:

let user = 'John'
  , age = 25
  , message = 'Hello';

Technically, all these variants do the same thing. So, it’s a matter of personal taste and aesthetics.

```
