    "\n",

    ">   * so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.\n",

    ">   * JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript,\n",

    "\n",
    "JavaScript’s abilities in the browser are limited to protect the user’s safety.\n",
    "The aim is to prevent an evil webpage from accessing private information or harming the user’s data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of such restrictions include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write arbitrary files on the hard disk, copy them or execute programs.\n",
    "  * It has no direct access to OS functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modern browsers allow it to work with files, but the access is limited and only provided\n",
    "  * if the user does certain actions, like “dropping” a file into a browser window or selecting it via an `<input>` tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are ways to interact with the camera/microphone and other devices,\n",
    "  * but they require a user’s explicit permission.\n",
    "  * So a JavaScript-enabled page may not sneakily enable a web-camera,\n",
    "    * observe the surroundings and send the information to the NSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Different tabs/windows generally do not know about each other.\n",
    "  * Sometimes they do,\n",
    "    * for example when one window uses JavaScript to open the other one.\n",
    "  * But even in this case,\n",
    "    * JavaScript from one page may not access the other page\n",
    "    * if they come from different sites (from a different domain, protocol or port).\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is called the “Same Origin Policy”.\n",
    "  * To work around that,\n",
    "    * both pages must agree for data exchange and must contain special JavaScript code that handles it.\n",
    "  * We’ll cover that in the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This limitation is, again, for the user’s safety.\n",
    "  * A page from `<http://anysite.com>`\n",
    "    * which a user has opened must not be able to access another browser tab with the URL `<http://gmail.com>`,\n",
    "    * for example, and steal information from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "* JavaScript can easily communicate over the net to the server where the current page came from.\n",
    "  * But its ability to receive data from other sites/domains is crippled.\n",
    "  * Though possible,\n",
    "    * it requires explicit agreement (expressed in HTTP headers) from the remote side.\n",
    "  * Once again, that’s a safety limitation.\n",
