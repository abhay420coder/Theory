# Solar panel setup cost

* There are three plant set up

  * on grid plant
  * off grid plant
  * hybrid plant
* 

## hybrid pland setup

* solar-plate emmits energy = 330watt (one solar panel emits 330 watts in one hour) *12

  * = 3960watt in one hour
  * = 3.9kw
  * it will generate 30 to 32kw in 8hour (if i consider 8 hour working day 9am to 5pm)
  * cost = 13000 ruppes *12 = 156000 rupees (1.5lakh)
* inverter cost = 
* stablizer cost =
* battery cost =
