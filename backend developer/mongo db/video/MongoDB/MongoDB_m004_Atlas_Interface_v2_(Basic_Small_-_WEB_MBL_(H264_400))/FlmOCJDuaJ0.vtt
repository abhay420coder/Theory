00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.210
Now that you have created your
cluster, loaded in the data,

3
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.910
and even created the first
user for your database,

4
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.240
it is time to explore the
Atlas interface a little more.

5
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.790
There are two navigation
panels, one at the top

6
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.870
and one on the
left of the screen.

7
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.440
The top navigation panel
allows you to access services

8
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.990
like charts and realms,
which we'll discuss later

9
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.360
in the last chapter
of this course.

10
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.330
The left navigation panel will
pertain more to the cluster

11
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.560
management itself.

12
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.080
Here, you can manage the
security settings and clusters

13
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.525
that you have as
part of this project.

14
00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:32.400
There are other features
here in the Atlas UI

15
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.940
which we will discuss later.

16
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.090
For now, let's focus on
this brand new cluster

17
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.900
that we created.

18
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.120
Mine is called sandbox.

19
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.670
In this course, we will interact
with our cluster and data

20
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.390
in two different ways.

21
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.510
One way is through
the Data Explorer,

22
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.090
which you can navigate to
by clicking the Collections

23
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.960
button.

24
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.910
This displays the
databases and collections

25
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.500
that you have in your cluster.

26
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.140
We will use this extensively
and go into more details

27
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.850
in the following chapters.

28
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.190
The other way we will
interact with this cluster

29
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.520
is through the shell, which we
will use in the next exercise.

30
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.959
Hit the Connect button.

31
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.080
If you haven't created a
user that is allowed access

32
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.660
to your cluster yet, then you
will be prompted to do so,

33
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.220
as well as to add any IP address
that should be allowed access

34
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.600
to this database.

35
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.480
For this course, you can
add 0.0.0.0 as the IP

36
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.300
to the access list, which will
allow access from anywhere.

37
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.640
Then create a user.

38
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.645
The username should be
m001-student, with the password

39
00:01:34.645 --> 00:01:35.980
m001-mongodb-basics.

40
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.650


41
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.850
When you're done with adding the
IP address to the access list

42
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.860
and creating a user,
you can move on

43
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.250
to connecting to your cluster.
