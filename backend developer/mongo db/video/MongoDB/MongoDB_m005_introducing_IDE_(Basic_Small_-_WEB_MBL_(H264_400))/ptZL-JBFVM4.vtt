00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
In this lesson, I
want to introduce you

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.250
to our in-browser IDE.

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.860
It's a space where you can
practice what you learned,

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.530
or get a grade for a lab
that you just completed.

5
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.740
But essentially, we want you to
get as much hands on practice

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.300
and learning as possible.

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.670
And that's what the IDE is for.

8
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.300
So this is an example of
an in-browser IDE lab.

9
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.510
There's the title of the
lesson, and the problem

10
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.000
description down here.

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.850
In this particular case,
it's an ungraded problem.

12
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.240
So as the description
says, practice

13
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.910
what you learned in earlier
lectures and maybe even

14
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.650
find answers to some
of the quiz questions.

15
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.880
So this is your sandbox
playground space.

16
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.700
If I click the
Launch IDE button,

17
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.070
I get to the actual
in-browser IDE.

18
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.510
So let's click that button.

19
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.220
So as you can see, the IDE
takes up a fair amount of space.

20
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.010
So you can collapse the IDE
using the minimized button

21
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.560
on the top right,
and then bring it

22
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.510
back up with the button
right next to it.

23
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.230
Let's examine it
a little closer.

24
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.060
There are multiple
tabs and windows

25
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.510
in this one little area.

26
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.170
So let's go left to right.

27
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.160
This tab, labeled Browse
Files, is a File Explorer

28
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.610
where you can browse the files
in your workspace directory.

29
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.580
These files are given to
you to edit for the lab.

30
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.130
You can also
collapse this window

31
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.210
for more space in the IDE.

32
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.490
The next section
is the File Editor.

33
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.830
The editor displays the
contents of the files

34
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.660
on the workspace
directory so you can

35
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.760
edit these files for the lab.

36
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.550
If you want to edit a file
in the workspace directory,

37
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.240
you can click on that
files tab and the editor,

38
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.620
or by selecting the file
name from the File Explorer.

39
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.480
You can edit these
files as you like

40
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.730
and the changes will
stay here unless you

41
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.950
reset the workspace, which
you can do by clicking

42
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.470
this button at the bottom.

43
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.725
So let's say I add a
new point to this file.

44
00:01:58.725 --> 00:02:04.140


45
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.440
I can refresh the page and
this update will still be here.

46
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.090
But once I hit reset workspace,
it'll ask me if I'm sure.

47
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.550
I click OK and now the
change that I made is gone.

48
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.000
So the workspace was completely
reset to what it was originally

49
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.590
configured with.

50
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.340
The files in this editor
usually have some code in them.

51
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.950
Whether it's a MongoDB
configuration file,

52
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.010
a JSON snippet,
or something else.

53
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.920
The next section of
the in-browser IDE

54
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.260
is the terminal window.

55
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.020
This is where you would issue
any shell commands required

56
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.130
for the exercise.

57
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.920
For example, I can check
what version of MongoDB

58
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.160
is installed.

59
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.190
And it looks like we
have MongoDB version 4.0.

60
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.230
You can also collapse
the terminal window

61
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.140
if you want more space
in the file editor.

62
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.480
If this is a graded
assignment, then there

63
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.750
will be some test cases you need
to run against your solution.

64
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.330
To run these tests, you
can hit the Run Test

65
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.320
button on the bottom right.

66
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.670
Running the test will open up
a new tab called Test Results.

67
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.340
This tab will show you
how many tests were run,

68
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.880
how many tests were passed, and
how many tests were skipped.

69
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.880
This assignment is not graded,
so we just added an example

70
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.190
test here that always passes.

71
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.930
If this was a graded
assignment, you

72
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.330
would get feedback
on your solution.

73
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.870
I can also collapse
this tab for more space.

74
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.110
Make sure, when you get
to an in-browser IDE lab,

75
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.990
to check whether or not
the assignment is graded.

76
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.790
I hope you enjoyed learning
with us and good luck.
